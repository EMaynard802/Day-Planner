# Day-Planner
A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). 

Add your task and click the save icon to store the task; otherwise, your tasks will not be saved upon page refresh. 

Additionally, each hour time slot is color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present, or the future. This will change depending on the time of day.
